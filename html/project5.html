        <h2>Professionalism</h2>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Definition</b></p>
        <p>To be professional is to perform effectively and responsibly when facing a professional task. That includes both local and international context. To be able to be professional, a strong emphasis should be put toward ethics. Also, diversity and negotiation skills for a modern work environment are important.</p>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 1: <a href="../Journals/Journal 1/Assignment 1 for UNIV1211-106 Prof. Develop. & Comp 2018 (1) (1).pdf" target="_blank">Professional Preparation Readiness</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>In this assignment the students were asked to take couple of personality tests and asked to reflect on the
            results of these tests. This artefact gave me a further understanding of my personality and an insight to
            why I behave certain ways, therefore, I picked this assignment to represent the professionalism competency.
            The skills used to develop this artefact were critical thinking, and self-understanding.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>This assignment taught me a lot about myself; for example, learned that I lean towards having more left-brain
            tendencies, which means I am more mathematical and logical. I also learned that understanding oneself is a
            crustal part of professional development. Moreover, I learned that all my action and interaction have a
            deeper explanation that seeds in my personality and bringing that to the surface by analysing it will help
            me further become a better part of society. To improve this assignment further I would dig deeper into my
            personality to have more understanding of who I am and why I behave the way I do. When doing similar
            assignment, I suggest not to take the final results of the tests as an absolute truth; instead, investigate
            and reflect on your answers.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 2: <a href="../Journals/Journal 1/Presentation (7).pdf" target="_blank">Social Equality (presentation)</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>The students were asked to pick a topic from the text book, search about it, and present it to the class.
            This assignment was done in groups. I picked this assignment to represent the professionalism because I
            think the topic of the presentation “Social Equality” is an important part of professional development. By
            presenting this topic, I developed a better presentation skill, and teamwork skills.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>From this assignment I learned the different types of equalities and how they can affect the professional
            development of various sectors of society. Furthermore, I learned that equality of opportunity is one of the
            most important equality, because without it, one can not develop professionally. To had had done this
            assignment better, I would read more about the different types of equalities, including the work environment
            equality. To whom interested in similar assignment, I suggest learning about more examples of such topic,
            further investigate your equality rights.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 3: <a href="../Journals/Journal 3/Assignment 2_201800290.pdf" target="_blank">Data Structure assignment II (Queues)</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>For this assignment students were asked to solve a problem using the knowledge they have in Java programming and what they just learned in data structure (Queues). The problem was about a line of customers in a bank, in which, a new customer arrives every four minutes, and every customer will take seven minutes to be served. We had to write a program that keeps track of this queue. This assignment relates to professionalism because, it taught me how to achieve a task effectively and responsibly. I chose this assignment in the professionalism category to show case a professional task related to my major (IT), and the way I approached the problem.  </p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>Going through this assignment made me think harder about the nature of it. I had to imagen how a queue actually works and how to keep track of it. Timing was important in this problem, as I had to keep track of arrival time, time of departure, how many customers are in the line, and who is being served in the moment. To do all that, I went back to the skills I learned in earlier course (Computer Since II). For example, how to manipulate loops in such way to be effective for this problem. I also learned from this assignment that sometimes the best solutions are not the most complicated. I believe this assignment has brought me a step forward towards professionalism.  If I had another shot at this assignment, I would consider visualizing it more, so that the user would have a better interaction with the program. To whom interested in such problem, I suggest trying to imagen the problem before start solving it. Once you fully understood how every part of the queue works, start working on the technical programing side.   </p>
