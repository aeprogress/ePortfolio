        <h2>Teamwork</h2>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Definition</b></p>
        <p>Teamwork is to be able to work effectively with others to accomplish common goals and perform tasks. Teamwork can be challenging specially because the group need to be organized and the tasks should be distributed by a leader. Therefore, one of the main elements of teamwork is a visionary leader.</p>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 1: <a href="../Journals/Journal 3/Chapter 6 reflection2.pdf" target="_blank">Northouse Chapter 6: Developing Leadership Skill (reflection paper)</a></b>
        </p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>After presenting this chapter with a group of four students, we were asked to write a reflection paper on the
            chapter. This artefact was chosen to represent my development in teamwork because I had to work with my
            group in harmony to write the reflection paper. We divided the work between us in such, each student reflect
            on the part he presented. Then we combined our writings in one paper and we added the prober connection
            words to make the transaction between the different reflections interwind. The skill that were used to
            develop this artefact was academic group writing.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>I learned from this assignment how to relate to others’ people work. By doing so, I was able to organize the
            points and the ideas I was reflecting about in sink with my team members. I also learned how to recognize
            the important point of the chapter and focus my writing on them. In order to improve our work further, I
            would go over what we wrote as a team with the instructor. To whom interested in such assignment I would
            advice you to gather with your team mate and find out the main points collectively, then start writing about
            them.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 2: <a href="../Journals/Journal 3/Chapter4.pdf" target="_blank">Self-Understanding (chapter presentation)</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>For this assignment two class mates and I summarized and prepared a presentation on a chapter of the critical
            thinking book by Richard Paul and Linda Elder. The topic was about self-understanding. This assignment was
            picked to represent the teamwork competency because of team effort spent on developing the presentation. The
            skills were used to develop this artefact are summarisation, presentation skills, and team collaboration.
        </p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>The skills learned in this project were an extension of what we were taught in previous projects; which
            include, communication skills; that is communication between team members and communication with the
            audience. Furthermore, I learned how to overcome a brain freeze during presentation by including more
            examples and relating to the audience. During preparation for the assignment, each team member presented
            Infront of other team member which was very beneficial to the whole team. To do this assignment a little bit
            better, during the presentation I would perhaps move from my stationary stat and be more dynamic in my
            movements. Lastly, I advise whoever interned in such assignment to practice the point he/she is presenting
            with his teammates; by doing so, you will notice a huge improvement in your presentation skills.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 3: <a href="../Journals/Journal 3/Network Management Project - Report.pdf" target="_blank">VLAN, VTP and Router on a stick</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>For this project students were asked to work in teams of four. The project involved simulating a network with specific features on a Cisco simulator (Packet Tracer) with a presentation. The project helped improve my teamwork skills by enforcing me to coordinate my part of the project with my group members. I took the lead in this project and organized who’s going to be responsible for which part of the project. This project also relates to team work as we had to exchange ideas, as a team, on how to approach the structure.  </p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>Simulating a network for this project with other people require a lot of communication. All the parts of the network had to be connected and well configured. Because of that, every step we took in this project we had to review together to make sure everything is still working. The best part was problem solving. By that I mean, whenever one of the team members got stuck, we all had to help each other to solve the problem. The best reward was when everything was connected and we made the whole network function. To do similar projects in the future better, I would give myself more time to understand the structure of the network and search more for different implementation to be more efficient. To those interested in doing this project, I advise you to make sure that you understand all the small steps of configuring each device in the network as each part plays a big role in the overall picture.</p>
