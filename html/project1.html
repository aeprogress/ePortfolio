        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Definition</b></p>
        <p>Communication is the sharing of meaningful concurrent ideas. To have the competency of communication is to be able to communicate in one or more languages in professional and social situations. Communication can be written, oral, or nonverbal.</p>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 1: <a href="../Journals/Journal 1/Assignmemt2.pdf" target="_blank">Letter of complaint</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>In this assignment the students were asked to group in pares of two, and one of the group members was asked
            to take the rowel of a manager of some sort, and the other member to be either a costumer or an employee
            with a complaint. The purpose of this assignment is to maintain a professional communication via emails. The
            skills were used in this assignment were group work, and professional writing.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>I learned from this assignment how to professionally communicate with other employee while maintaining an
            advantage. Dealing with an angry employer or employee can go south very fast, unless, some professional
            communication skills were used. These skills include; using proper language, staying away from insulting the
            receiver, keeping focused on the subject matter. To do this assignment better I would support my arguments
            with more avoidances, such as providing prove of hard work and such. To whom interested in doing similar
            assignment I advise you to go throw the points mentioned in each email with your group member, and think of
            ways to write it better. By doing so, the final draft of the assignment will be much clearer and
            professional.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 2: <a href="../Journals/Journal 1/Abdulrahman Aleid_201800290_A HISTORY OF SURGERY.pdf" target="_blank">A Brief History of Surgery</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>In this assignment the students were asked to group in pares of two, and one of the group members was asked
            to take the rowel of a manager of some sort, and the other member to be either a costumer or an employee
            with a complaint. The purpose of this assignment is to maintain a professional communication via emails. The
            skills were used in this assignment were group work, and professional writing.In this assignment we were
            asked to search about a topic of our choice about, and present a short history of the topic in ten minutes.
            This artefact improved my oral communication skills, there for, I picked it to represent the communication
            competency. The skills were used to develop this artefact were research skills, writing skills, and
            personation skills.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>I learned many thingy things from this assignment. Most importantly I learned how to properly search about a
            topic that I had no background about. As a result, I developed new searching skills in which I stated to
            distinguish between what is key point and should be included in my personation and which was not. Also, I
            learned how to properly present a topic and having a smooth flow throughout the presentation. Furthermore,
            we thought how to make eye contact during the presentation and how to use the body language to reflect what
            I was talking about. To prefect this assignment better I would include the audience in the presentation
            more. Lastly, when doing a similar assignment I recommend practicing the presentation with your friends or
            family members or take a video of yourself to reflect on your performance.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 3: <a href="../Journals/Journal 1/Creation of a Technical Manual.pdf" target="_blank">Coding Java with NetBeans: Starter’s Manual</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>For this assignment students were divided into groups of three members. We were asked to choose a subject to 
            create a technical manual. All members of my group were in the computer science collage. so, we picked a topic 
            that we can all relate to. NetBeans is a program that compiles different types of programing languages. 
            After doing the necessary research, we started writing and designing the manual. This assignment relates to 
            communication competency; as it taught me how to communicate my ideas with my group members, and how to write 
            and design a technical manual. </p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>Writing a manual for the first time was an interesting experience. One of the things I learned doing this assignment 
            is how to be practical and precise while brief. I also learned how to find critical points and organize them in chronological 
            order. When communicating one has to consider the audience. By doing so, we were able to make a clear and easy to read manual. 
            Working in a team for this assignment was very productive. Everyone shared what they think the manual should look like 
            and what are the most important steps that should be mentioned in it. This teamwork taught me how to explain what 
            I was thinking and how to compromise my idea for a better one. If I had to do a manual again, I would test my work 
            by consulting expert individuals on the manual subject. To whom interested on doing similar assignment, I suggest 
            looking into reference models and understanding which models would fit your manual topic, then make your won.</p>
