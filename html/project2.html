        <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Definition</b></p>
        <p>Critical thinking is achieving intended goals by being able to reason logically and creatively. By doing so, decisions will be made responsibly and based on informed thinking. The process of decision making involves; creating a constructive environment, generating good alternatives, exploring the alternatives, choosing the best alternative, checking the decision, and communicating the decision and taking action.</p>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 1: <a href="../Journals/Journal 3/Assignment 2 Crime And Punishment Case_Group2.pdf" target="_blank">Crime and Punishment Case</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>In this assignment the students were asked to read a legal case, analyse and understand the event’s that took
            place in the case, and answer specific critical question related to the case. I chose this assignment
            because, it gave me the chance to practice certain critical thinking skills. These skills include; reading
            with critical eyes, relating the events that took place with each other and coming up with the best
            solution.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>This assignment taught me many critical thinking skills, one of which was the ability to carefully analyse
            the problem that was put Infront of me and understand all of its components. Also, I learned how to come up
            with different solutions before deciding which one will be the best for the situation. Finally, testing the
            solution by predicting the outcome. A better way for me to had had done this assignment would be by perhaps
            consulting someone who has a background on the subject of the case study. To whom is intrusted in doing a
            similar project, I recommend carefully reading the case before rushing to conclusions.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 2: <a href="../Journals/Journal 3/201800290_Abdulrahmn Aleid_Assignment 4.pdf" target="_blank">Decision Making</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>In this assignment the students were given a scenario in which we had to make a job-related decision. I
            picked this assignment because it put me in a real-life situation that very likely I will experience in my
            future work career. The skills used to develop this artefact were critical reading, academic writing and
            critical thinking.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>I learned from this assignment not to rush when making a life changing decision. Furthermore, I learned to
            explore all the options available and make sure I understand the consequence of each one. Lastly, I
            understood that asking to inform myself of possible solutions is of major importance. If I were to repeat
            this assignment to do it better, I would not restrict myself with the options I was given in the scenario,
            instead I would think more outside of “the box”. When completing similar projects, I recommend to ask the
            teacher for other possible choices that might but you in a better place when making the decision.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 3: <a href="../Journals/Journal 2/Abdulrahman Aleid_201800290_Assi!.pdf" target="_blank">Cover Letter for a Job Application</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>For this assignment students were asked to find a real-life job offer to apply for and write a cover letter 
            to include with the resumé. To find a job offer we had to make a decision to what fits our current qualifications 
            which forced us to be critical. The job I chose was a cashier job at a grocery store.  Moreover, we had to 
            persuade the employer why we are fit for the job which pushed us to think critically about our best strengths 
            and emphasize them. The assignment was practical as it gave us a real sense on how to think when applying for a job.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>Writing a cover letter put me in a situation in which I had to analyze and further understand myself. To do so I 
            thought about the time I worked in a grocery store back when I was in Canada. I learned how to go through the 
            different strengths I have and pick the most persuasive one, therefore, a serious critical thinking took place. 
            Giving the fact that I lived and worked abroad, I chose adaptability as my strongest suit.  Moreover, I learned 
            that having the qualifications is not enough, however, being unique among your peers is critical. Lastly, I learned 
            that being more informed about the company you are applying for, could make a big difference for your case. If I had 
            to write an application letter again, I would consider visiting the company I am applying for and perhaps ask git more 
            information from the employees who work there. When doing such assignment, I suggest doing a research about the company 
            to have a better understanding of their principles and ideals. </p>
