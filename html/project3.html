        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Definition</b></p>
        <p>Leadership is the ability to motivate a group of people to accomplish a vision while being informed and responsible. The responsibility of being a leader could take different shapes or status; such as, in a family, community, organization, or country. Furthermore, leaders connect people together by giving them tasks to achieve a common goal.</p>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 1: <a href="../Journals/Journal 3/Chapter 6 reflection2.pdf" target="_blank">Framework Exercises, Textbook Chapter Analysis</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>Each group of students were asked to read and understand a chapter of the textbook and present it to the
            class. The chapter that was assigned to my group is about “developing leadership skills”. This assignment
            allowed me to work in a group which helped me practice some leadership skills, such as; encouraging my group
            members to finish their part of the presentation. The skills used in this artefact were, taking the lead
            when working in group, and presentation skills.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>The process of preparing the presentation taught me how to work in a team, and how to motivate my team mate
            to prepare. Also, I learned how to organize the slides of the presentation, and how to use these slid while
            presenting. The subject of the topic we presented was very informative. It covered the essential parts of
            leadership skills; administrative Skills, interpersonal Skills and conceptual Skills. The main thing I
            learned in this assignment is being a leader is not just about having authority but also, being a visionary
            and a skilful speaker who can motivate others to follow him. One thing I would improve about this assignment
            is to have the audience participate more during the presentation. Finally, I would advise when implementing
            similar assignment to be involved with your group members and listen to the suggestion they might give you.
        </p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 2: <a href="../Journals/Journal 3/Leadership Personal Philosophy and Reflection _Adulrahman-Aleid_201800290.pdf" target="_blank">Leadership Personal Philosophy and Reflection</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>In this assignment we were asked to write our own understanding of leadership, based on life experiences and
            what was learned in the course. I picked this assignment because, it represents my own experience with
            leadership. The skills developed used in developing this artefact were academic writing and analytical
            reflection of past experiences.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>I learned from this assignment to always relate to past experiences, wither the experience was a positive one
            or otherwise. Also, I learned to that we all have certain understanding of topics, such as leadership, we
            gain this understanding by either having a proper education or by expertise. So, I was able to reflect on my
            personal understanding of what leadership is about and I gave a personal story on practicing leadership and
            being in a team led by someone. To further perfect this assignment I would include my father as the first
            leader in my life; form whom I learned plenty of skills. Lastly, when attempting this assignment, one might
            have the sense that he/she does not have anything to say about a topic like leadership, however, one must
            dig deeper into his/her life, and think of the rowel models that gave him/her the impression of being
            professional leaders. Then use those leaders to reflect on your understanding of leadership.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 3: <a href="../Journals/Journal 1/business proposal (final).pdf" target="_blank">Presentation of a Business Proposal: e-Landscape</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>In a group of four, my colleagues and I came up with a business idea to present in class. The idea was 
            about a company that empowers small to medium Saudi businesses technologically. Which includes designing and 
            hosting websites, maintaining websites and databases, and offering customer service. As an Information Technology 
            (IT) student I was very excited for this assignment. The main thing relates this assignment to leadership is the 
            importance of having a vison. Also, working in a group for this assignment gave me an idea on how to help a team 
            achieve their goal.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>First of all, coming up with an idea for this assignment was a process of thinking and rethinking. Having an idea was 
            not enough, but relating it to market needs and envisioning creative ways to market it were even more important. 
            From this assignment I learned to be visionary however realistic. I learned how to support my ideas with concrete 
            solutions to problems we might face. I also learned that being a leader means having the right people around you 
            to make your vison come true. For example, we had to decide how many employees our company will have, what are their 
            qualifications, and how the work will flow between them. In addition, we had to distribute a limited budget on different 
            company costs which taught me how to be more economical. These skills I learned are essential to be a successful leader. 
            If I had another shot at this assignment, I would read more on business related topics to get a better since on how businesses 
            are run. To those interested in doing similar assignment, I advise you to carefully plan for it. That includes; market needs, 
            location, costs, customer demographics, etc. Finally, I strongly advise you to be confidant in yourself and your idea.</p>
