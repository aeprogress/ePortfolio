        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Definition</b></p>
        <p>Having the competency of technology is to be able to use modern technologies to research for information, communicate, solve problems, and produce intended results. Known the way information flows and the possibility of faulty information is important. Technology can be a strong tool if well harnessed.</p>
        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 1: <a href="../Journals/Journal 2/201800290_Abdulrahman Aleid_Assignment 3.pdf" target="_blank">Cyber Stalking (paper)</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>The students were asked to search about the topic of cyber stalking and write a short paper about it. Given
            that my major is Information Technology, the topic of this artefact is one of the most interesting topics I
            searched about. In the process of working on this assignment I developed more researching skills and
            academic writing skills.</p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>This artefact taught me that every major has its unethical side. Furthermore, gaining expertise in a
            technology major requires understanding of how dangerous some people can be in the technology world. Also, I
            learned that using technology is very important for our professional development. To improve this assignment
            further, I would include more examples of true stories to clarify the dangers of cyber stalking. Finally, if
            you are interested in such assignment, I recommend watching the documents available online that will give
            you a broad over view of cyber stalking.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 2: Website Project</b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>As part of the web programming course, the students were asked to develop a website of six pages related to each other.  This artefact was chosen to represent the technology competency because, it was one of the main projects that helped me develop writing code. The skills developed while working on this assignment were programming, and design.
        </p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>I learned from this project how to connect different ideas in one platform. Also, I learned how to use the lessons we learn in the class creatively. To prepare for this project, I learned how to brain storm ideas and how to be inspired by the experts. Organization brain mapping was a big part of the project. To improve this project further, I would ask different people on what they think about the website I made and how they think it can be optimized. To whom interested in similar projects, I suggest practicing as much as possible with different ideas.</p>

        <p class="assignment"><b>Assignment 3: <a href="../Journals/Journal 2/Abdulrahman Aleid_201800290_History paper.pdf" target="_blank">The Conflict Between the Working Class and Businessmen in Industrialized England from 1830 to 1850</a></b></p>
        <p class="underline">Introduction</p>
        <p>The topic for this assignment was picked for a research paper for the World Civilizations course. The research focuses on the period between 1830 and 1850. It discusses the after math of the industrial revolution on the working class of the United Kingdom and the different conflicts it caused with businessmen. The use of electronic libraries to find resources, and researching websites for scalarly articles and images relates this assignment to the technology competency. </p>
        <p class="underline">Reflection</p>
        <p>The Internet has advanced the way people conduct their research. I learned from the assignment how to properly use the tools that the Internet has to offer. For example, PMU provides their students with a verity of online libraries which made the search for e-books related to the topic of the research much easier. Also, to narrow down the research, tools to filter the research are provided. Furthermore, using google scholar is a very helpful way to find scholarly articles. I also learned what makes a resource valuable by considering the author the year of publication and the publisher. Reviewing the references of a resource is important as well. If I was given another chance to do this paper, I would start reading the resources earlier so that I can include more information. To whom interested in writing a similar paper, I advise you to take advantage of all the electronic libraries available to you. In addition, to have a well-researched paper, start searching as soon as you can and give yourself enough time to read all the resources.</p>
