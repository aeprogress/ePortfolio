        <p class="underline"><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p class="assignmentBody">This project started as an assignment for the Data Structure course. The assignment was about writing a program that duplicates the movement of the knight in a chess game. After doing the assignment the instructor challenged us with a project. The challenge was to turn this assignment into an interactive game, with a different programming language than what we used in the assignment. So, I took on that challenge and I created a webpage of the game.</p>
        <p class="underline"><b>Reflection</b></p>
        <p class="assignmentBody">I was excited to do this project, because, I wanted to apply what I learned in the Web programming course. Figuring out the technical problem of the knight movement in the assignment before starting this project was very helpful. I focused more on the design of the game and the interaction part where I took into consideration the user. In the assignment I used Java as a programming language, whereas, for the project I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the web page. During this project I stumbled a bone many small issues which forced me to search for solutions and learn more thing I didn’t know before. The instructor was pleased with the results of the project which endrudged me to work harder in future projects. Looking back at this project, I would definitely change a lot of things. For example, the way I organized the code. The more I learn about coding the more I see how much I can improve on my previous projects. To whom interested in similar project, I advise you to first work on the main problem of the project and do not waist time on the complementary parts. Once you’re done with that, start looking for different designs to have an idea how to create your own.</p>
