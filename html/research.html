        <p class="underline"><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p class="assignmentBody">For the Writing and Research course, students were asked to pick a topic related to their culture and write a paper on it. The topic I chose was about consanguinity in Saudi Arabia and the related health issues. Relatives marriage is very common in the Arabic region, especially Saudi Arabia, despite the health consequences of it. So, I decided to shed a light on the matter by writing a researched paper.</p>
        <p class="underline"><b>Reflection</b></p>
        <p class="assignmentBody">Going through scientific findings and the health papers written on the topic taught me a lot about how to extract trustworthy information. In addition, I did a short survey to understand how much Saudi people are aware of the consequences of consanguinity. I also learned how to organize a research paper; starting from the introduction, followed by literature review, methodology, findings, and conclusion. The paper took quite a while to write, however, every step was mind opening. If I had a chance to write this paper again, I would perhaps interview medical experts to gain more knowledge on the topic. To whom interested in similar research, I suggest with every step you take toward writing the paper, keep review it with your instructor to make sure you are in the right path. Keeping your instructor in the loop will reduce the amount of time and effort you spend, and you will learn and improve faster.</p>
